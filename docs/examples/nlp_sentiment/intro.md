In this tutorial, you will learn how to leverage Modelkit as a support for a common NLP task: Sentiment Analysis.

You will see how Modelkit can be useful as you progress along the following steps:

1. Implementing the Tokenizer leveraging spaCy
2. Implementing the Vectorizer leveraging Scikit-Learn
3. Building a simple Classifier leveraging Keras to predict whether a review is negative or positive

Last but not least, you will get to see how a breaze it is to speed up your go-to-production process with Modelkit.
